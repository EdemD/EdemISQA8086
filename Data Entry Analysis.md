### 1: Based on our class readings, prior experience, and your own good sense, list some of the problems in the way that the data are currently organized (there are at least 10 problems with these spreadsheets; try to identify as many as possible, but at least 6).

  1. Missing data/values (Temperature, colony size) where a recording should be present
  
  2. Inconsistent columns names across spreadsheet - This can lead to error and interpretation 
  3. The earliest year measurement ( File 1 – Pond 2010) is missing the “Chla” column
  4. According to established standards, it appears that aquatic scientists collect plankton data samples during both day and night but it appears data is being collected 3 times a day at various depth on our spreadsheets. This is suspect and must be investigated.  
  5. Not fully understandable/identifiable columns name as data definition is missing from the spreadsheet
  6. Not fully understandable/identifiable of specific measurement across the difference spreadsheet
  7. No clear identification of when the measurements are taken
  8. Some “Chippo # L” column for instance were negative which is impossible

### 2: Suggest a new system for organization. Create a table in your Markdown document showing a potential template for later years of data collection that would address the problems you identified in #1. 

> Based on findings and additional readings and to make future recordings more query friendly I propose the table format below. Of course a well written data definition is needed to go along with this table.
